# scraps-Twitter-accounts
use Python to create a tool that scraps Twitter accounts for data. 
The scraper will take an input of 10 Twitter accounts and scrape them every X minutes, looking for mentions of stock symbols.

This is what a stock symbol looks like on Twitter: ‘’$TSLA’’ – there will always be a Cashtag “$” before it
Your script inputs should be
List of Twitter Accounts 
Ticker (the $ with a 4 or 3 letter word) to look for
The time interval for another scraping session
The output displayed should be:
The number of times the stock symbol was mentioned
Stock Symbol (e.g. $TSLA, $SOFI, $APPL, etc.)
The time interval used

Output example: “‘’$TSLA’’ was mentioned ‘’10’’ times in the last ‘’15’’ minutes.”

Use these 10 Twitter accounts:
